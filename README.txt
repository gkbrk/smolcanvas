smolcanvas
==========

smolcanvas is a 2D canvas graphics library. It is a thin wrapper around the 2D
Canvas API.

The library is type-annotated with JSDoc comments in order to assist the Closure
compiler and other JS optimizers. When compiled with optimizations, the library
code mostly turns into raw Canvas calls.
